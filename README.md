## Introduction

Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a computational method for separating a multivariate signal into additive, independent non-Gaussian components. It is widely used in fields such as signal processing, neural network research, and bioinformatics. This repository provides the following:

- Implementation of  ICA algorithms.
- Applications of ICA in different domains.
- PCA and kernel PCA implementation

## Agorithms
Implementations of ICA , PCA , kernelPCA are also provided

## Applications

Several applications  are provided to demonstrate the use of ICA algorithms on different datasets. 

    * Noise reduction.
    * Artifact removal.
    * Face recognition .
    * Blind source separation
    * Dimension reduction.
